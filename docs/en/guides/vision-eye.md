# VisionEye View Object Mapping using Ultralytics YOLO11 ðŸš€

## What is VisionEye Object Mapping?

[Ultralytics YOLO11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/) VisionEye offers the capability for computers to identify and pinpoint objects, simulating the observational [precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision) of the human eye. This functionality enables computers to discern and focus on specific objects, much like the way the human eye observes details from a particular viewpoint.

        ```python
        import cv2

        from ultralytics import YOLO
        from ultralytics.utils.plotting import Annotator, colors

        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video/file.mp4")
        w, h, fps = (int(cap.get(x)) for x in (cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))

        out = cv2.VideoWriter("visioneye-pinpoint.avi", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"MJPG"), fps, (w, h))

        center_point = (-10, h)

        while True:
            ret, im0 = cap.read()
            if not ret:
                print("Video frame is empty or video processing has been successfully completed.")
                break

            annotator = Annotator(im0, line_width=2)

            results = model.track(im0, persist=True)
            boxes = results[0].boxes.xyxy.cpu()

            if results[0].boxes.id is not None:
                track_ids = results[0].boxes.id.int().cpu().tolist()

                for box, track_id in zip(boxes, track_ids):
                    annotator.box_label(box, label=str(track_id), color=colors(int(track_id)))
                    annotator.visioneye(box, center_point)

            out.write(im0)
            cv2.imshow("visioneye-pinpoint", im0)

            if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
                break

        out.release()
        cap.release()
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()
        ```

## FAQ

### How do I start using VisionEye Object Mapping with Ultralytics YOLO11?

To start using VisionEye Object Mapping with Ultralytics YOLO11, first, you'll need to install the Ultralytics YOLO package via pip. Then, you can use the sample code provided in the documentation to set up [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) with VisionEye. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video/file.mp4")

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    results = model.predict(frame)
    for result in results:
        # Perform custom logic with result
        pass

    cv2.imshow("visioneye", frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### What are the key features of VisionEye's object tracking capability using Ultralytics YOLO11?

VisionEye's object tracking with Ultralytics YOLO11 allows users to follow the movement of objects within a video frame. Key features include:

1. **Real-Time Object Tracking**: Keeps up with objects as they move.
2. **Object Identification**: Utilizes YOLO11's powerful detection algorithms.
3. **Distance Calculation**: Calculates distances between objects and specified points.
4. **Annotation and Visualization**: Provides visual markers for tracked objects.

Here's a brief code snippet demonstrating tracking with VisionEye:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video/file.mp4")

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    results = model.track(frame, persist=True)
    for result in results:
        # Annotate and visualize tracking
        pass

    cv2.imshow("visioneye-tracking", frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### How can I calculate distances with VisionEye's YOLO11 model?

Distance calculation with VisionEye and Ultralytics YOLO11 involves determining the distance of detected objects from a specified point in the frame. It enhances spatial analysis capabilities, useful in applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance.

Here's a simplified example:

```python
import math

import cv2

from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video/file.mp4")
center_point = (0, 480)  # Example center point
pixel_per_meter = 10

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    results = model.track(frame, persist=True)
    for result in results:
        # Calculate distance logic
        distances = [
            (math.sqrt((box[0] - center_point[0]) ** 2 + (box[1] - center_point[1]) ** 2)) / pixel_per_meter
            for box in results
        ]

    cv2.imshow("visioneye-distance", frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
