## FAQ

### How does Ultralytics YOLO11 Calculate dwell time?

Ultralytics YOLO11, the latest advancement in the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, is a state-of-the-art deep learning model tailored for real-time object detection and behavior analysis. It powers the Dwell Time Analyzer by leveraging its cutting-edge capabilities in detecting and tracking objects or users in dynamic environments.

### Can I use Ultralytics YOLO11 to perform object tracking and counting time for objects simultaneously?

Yes, Ultralytics YOLO11 can certainly be used to perform object tracking and calculate dwell time. `DwellTimeAnalyzer` solution integrated with object tracking models. To do so, you need to initialize the dwelltimeanalyzer object and use YOLO11's tracking capabilities. Here's a simple example:

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import solutions

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video/file.mp4")

# Get video properties
w = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
h = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
fps = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))

analyzer = solutions.DwellTimeAnalyzer(show=True, model="yolo11n.pt", fps=fps, classes=[1, 2])

while cap.isOpened():
    success, im0 = cap.read()
    if not success:
        break
    im0 = analyzer.count(im0)
    cv2.imshow("analyzer", im0)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

For more information on YOLO11's unique features, visit the [Ultralytics YOLO11 Introduction](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/introducing-ultralytics-yolov8).

### How can I Count Dwell Time only for specific object classes using Ultralytics YOLO11?

You can count dwell time for specific object classes by specifying the desired classes at the initialization of the `DwellTimeAnalyzer()` class of the YOLO model. For instance, if you only want to visualize cars and persons (assuming their class indices are 0 and 2), you can set the `classes` parameter accordingly.

```python
import cv2

from ultralytics import solutions

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video/file.mp4")

# Get video properties
w = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
h = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
fps = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))

analyzer = solutions.DwellTimeAnalyzer(show=True, model="yolo11n.pt", fps=fps)

while cap.isOpened():
    success, im0 = cap.read()
    if not success:
        break
    im0 = analyzer.count(im0)
    cv2.imshow("analyzer", im0)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
